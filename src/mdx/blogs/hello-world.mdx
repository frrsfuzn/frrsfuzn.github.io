# Preface

I've developed a keen interest in Vim for its unparalleled flexibility in enabling users to navigate and manipulate text seamlessly, all without lifting a finger off the keyboard.However, a challenge presents itself. Using native Vim can be a rather dull and challenging experience. In my initial encounter with Vim, I found myself stuck, unable to even exit the program! But fear not, as salvation arrives in the form of the Vim Extension for VSCode. Picture this: the power of Vim, seamlessly integrated into your VSCode environment. It might not replicate the full Vim experience, but for beginners eager to dip their toes into Vim without the steep learning curve, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try.
