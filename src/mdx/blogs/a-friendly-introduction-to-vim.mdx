# Preface

I've developed a keen interest in Vim for its unparalleled flexibility in enabling users to navigate and manipulate text seamlessly, all without lifting a finger off the keyboard.However, a challenge presents itself. Using native Vim can be a rather dull and challenging experience. In my initial encounter with Vim, I found myself stuck, unable to even exit the program! But fear not, as salvation arrives in the form of the Vim Extension for VSCode. Picture this: the power of Vim, seamlessly integrated into your VSCode environment. It might not replicate the full Vim experience, but for beginners eager to dip their toes into Vim without the steep learning curve, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try.

# Why should I use VIM?

VIM allows you to increase your productivity. With all of the navigation and manipulation of the text within your finger, you don't have to waste your time lifting your palm and moving your mouse. VIM also allows you to perform complex operations with fewer keystrokes. That's the power of VIM.

# But, it's hard to learn

Admittedly, mastering VIM comes with a learning curve. As the saying goes, "With great power comes great responsibility." However, don't let the initial challenge deter you. Numerous online resources can guide you through the learning process, making it accessible to everyone. Here are some recommended websites to help you kickstart your VIM journey:

- [openvim](https://www.openvim.com/)
- [vim-adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)

If you follow the tutorial that I mentioned above, you'll learn most of the basics of using VIM. Especially the way you quit VIM, hehe.

# But, native VIM looks boring!

Then you should use LazyVIM. It's pre-configured VIM so it looks so much interesting. There are also many added features that help you to increase your productivity. Here's the link to the LazyVIM

# Conclusion

While the initial learning curve might seem daunting, the rewards of mastering VIM are well worth the effort. Don't push yourself to hard, start with small steps and maintain consistency throughout your journey.
